    What is Rain
 </h2>
 <p>
<span style ="color:black; font-size: 2.0em;"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain"> Rain </a> </span> is water droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then fall under gravity.<br> Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water <br>on the Earth
    onent of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth.<br> It provides water for hydroelectric power plants, crop irrigation, and suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems.<br>
The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture <br> contrasts known as weather fronts. If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls<br> from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds)<br> which can organize into narrow rainbands.
